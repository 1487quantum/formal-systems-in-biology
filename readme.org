* Formal Systems in Biology

A collection of resources that apply formal systems to model biological processes.
Some easily accessible books to understand the general approaches in this field are also included.

McCullouch and Pitts study of neurons in biology birthed the pivotal paper that kickstarted A.I., [[https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2008/RM704.pdf][regular languages]], and digital computers. It was the only paper included in [[http://abelgo.cn/cs101/papers/Neumann.pdf][the EDVAC report]] by John Von Neumann.

An interactive demo of their model is available here: https://justinmeiners.github.io/neural-nets-sim/

* Further Research

- Rashevsky and Rosen

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Rashevsky][Rashevsky]] devised the [[https://doi.org/10.1002%2Fjhbs.1094][primary model of neural networks]] which was interpreted using the boolean language by McCullough/Pitts. His student [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rosen_(theoretical_biologist)][Robert Rosen]] went on to work on using Category Theory to model biology. These works need to be catalogued here. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon][Herbert Simon]] was also his student.

There could also be more possible works from the conference where McCullough presented his work and met Pitts.

- Ilya Pregorine’s Work

- Gregory Chaitin’s work
